        <div class="container">
            <h2>Stations</h2><hr>
            There are multiple rules you have to follow when you build a station.
             
            <h3>Naming</h3>
             - A station can not have multiple names, and it can not have the same name as an unrelated station; <br>
             - A good station name is the name of the building or monument or whatever is next to, or featured in the station. <br>
            <h3>Building</h3>
             - A station pillar consists of one Tuff Brick Wall, a Chiseled Tuff Brick block on top, with signs on all (at least 3) sides, followed by 2 to 3 more Tuff Brick Walls on top; <br>
             - The type of sign has not yet been standardized, however Warped Sign is recommended (Birch Sign also looks good); <br>
             - The station stop consists of 2 dug up blocks next to each other, next to the station pillar, with 2 powered rails in it, connected by a button (of any kind, but blackstone works best). <br>
            Also, consider adding powered rails close to each sides of the station.

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            When building a new station, if adding onto another existing line, you must test it up to the 2 stations next to it in both directions.
            <h3>Station Upgrade</h3>
            If the line is way too fast, and the station stop is too weak, consider upgrading your station stop by adding this to it: <br><img src="../assets/regulationsExamples/stationUpgrade.png"/> Slime Killing Simulator Station<br>
            You can adjust the number of powered rails on the stopper to adjust the strength of it. <br>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Lines</h2><hr>
            First off, an SGTT line <b>MUST</b> be connected to another line. <br>
            It can also connect to a nether line, like lines 1 - N1 - 4. Just keep that in mind. Thank you. <br>
            Also, when building a line, please be sure that there's enough powered rails, for the minecart to go at least somewhat fast
            <hr>
            <h2>Branches</h2><hr>
            <h3>What is a branch?</h3>
            A branch is a line that starts in the middle of another, bigger line. <br>
            They have a special name, with a letter at the end (Examples: 1Z, 2A) <br>
            (Exceptions to this naming scheme: lines 7A, 7B) <br>
            <h3>Branch Ends Special Station Type</h3>
            A normal Branch End's Station should look like this: <br>
            <img src="../assets/regulationsExamples/branch.png"/> LINE 2B
            <hr><h3>Testing</h3>
            Whatever you do, after you finish building a station, PLEASE!! test it. Test both directions. do it.
            <hr>
            <h3>Consider checking for</h3>
             - Have all signs been placed correctly?; <br>
             - Do all station stops work? (button available, stop itself stops); <br>
             - Is the minecart fast enough? Are there enough powered rails?
            <h3>If station stop too weak</h3>
            Consider scrolling up to Stations - Station Upgrade

            <h2>SIGN CONTENTS</h2><hr>
            EVERYTHING ON SIGNS <b>MUST</b> BE IN ALL-CAPS!
            <h3>Station</h3>
             - The station name, on the first or second line; <br>
             - "LINES: " Followed by all lines that stop here, in numerical order. (This includes branch ends)

            <h2>IF YOU WANT YOUR STATIONS TO LOOK DIFFERENT...</h2><hr>
            Do it! We don't care. Just stop following the rules about what blocks you should use. Do follow the rest though.
